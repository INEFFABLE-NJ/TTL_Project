Breast Cancer Prediction
This project focuses on the development of machine learning models for the diagnosis of breast cancer. Leveraging digitized images of breast mass, the aim is to accurately classify tumors as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). By employing various classification algorithms and advanced data analysis techniques, this project endeavors to contribute to the improvement of breast cancer diagnosis and patient care.
